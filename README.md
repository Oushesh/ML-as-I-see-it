## Why for me?
  As mentioned by Einstein, physics is about explaining the day-to-day observation and phenomeon.
  Analogically Engineering is about optimising day to day practices such that life works at "click of a button".

  A Computer Vision and Deep Learning Engineer day to day life involve a lot of protoyping, training
  neural networks, building PoCs, MVPs and putting features into production as in my case.


  To maintain the same level of enthusiasm: one needs to automate things that are mundane and leave more
  time for the exciting things which the reason of this git.

  It is basically ML-as-I-see it based on the naming of Einstein's book 'The World as I see it'

## Why for Companies?
    An AI Company has to be able to move fast through thousands of product iterations fast.

    The aim in Machine Learning is pipeline perfection and automation to unlift the repetitive mundane tasks so that the Data Scientists and Deep Learning Engineers can focus on the creative jobs of R&D.

    One objective as mentioned above is speed and efficiency.
    Second objective is based on my life principle "Weniger aber Besser"
    (Moto of Porsche introduced by Dr. Ferdinand Porsche).
    Its not about how much features you make but how good only 1 feature is.
    And also I am a Porsche Fan.
