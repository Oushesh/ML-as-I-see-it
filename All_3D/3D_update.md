## The Biggest Trends and Demistifying everything:


## Nerf vs Sfm
   or if I have Sfm why use the state of the art Nerf?
   Good Question: NerF uses SfM to establish the relative
   coordinates of the image set. Then, it learns an implicit
   function mapping points in space to a density and color,
   while using the true camera coordinates & pixel values
   as supervision.


   In a nutshell, you interpolate in between the scenes.

   Sfm is sparse a more brute force approach whereas Nerf is more
   of synthesis of novel views which are quite sharp and real like.
