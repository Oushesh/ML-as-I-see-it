## why Reference?


## Advantages
    * One simple advantage of reference is to avoid copy of huge/large data structures: Imagine a function that has to receive a large object. If we pass it without reference, a new copy of it is created which causes wastage of CPU time and memory. Reference is used to avoid this.

    Example Below:

    * For each loop to avoid the copy of objects: We can use references in each loop
    to avoid a copy of individual objects when objects are large.

    * For instance:
      good for use with vector data structure for printing purposes.
