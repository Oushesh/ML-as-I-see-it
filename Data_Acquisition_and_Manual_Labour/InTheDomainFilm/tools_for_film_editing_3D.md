## Purpose of Markdown_file
   * This markdown file containts brief overview of tools developed for 3D film making and video editing.

   * Similar to the tools showed for the Virtual Try-on for shoes
     I made a tool for Video editing using Generative GAN inpainting Techniques and Neural Network for Optical Flow estimation to stabilize the inpainting method.

     The aim was to make process of tagging and removing objects from video scenes
     easier without having to/or with minimum effort.

     The idea is to similarly outline the power of propagating information in videos
     rather than doing retagging and paying 3D artists or annotators. (its much more accurate
     and the propagation allows for major contributions in efficiency of data collection
     and annotation)
     A word of caution: I categorize it as: (Semi-automatic)
