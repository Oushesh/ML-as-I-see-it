## Resource: From Siraj Raval:

## Demo: transferring the a CPU code to GPU code by SIRA RAWAL  

## OpenCL, OpenACC, Nvidia Cuda
   * OpenCL allows to do hetereogeneous computing across GPUs from different vendors. i.e. writing code for multiple GPUs. Nonehteless, we stick to Nvidia GPUs for now.


## How does it work in a Nutshell?


    *  Now that you have seen the problems of defining the number of threadblock and blockdimension for each GPU hardware for which you specifically want to optimise the code.

    Solution: PyCuDa --> abstracts this away.
